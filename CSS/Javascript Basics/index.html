                <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons.
                    It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. 
                    Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Nodeserver), it can be connected to the objects of its environment to 
                    provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. - 
                            imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.
                            All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. these unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - 
                            our cup can now have a coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment 
                            operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x =10;</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            <a href="#">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables 
                            you need to know the date type. There are six data types taht are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - 
                            <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> 
                            or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span>[1,"Coding Dojo"];</span> 
                            and Object - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="#">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - 
                        hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in 
                        your code to accomplish this. There are the following condition statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, 
                        do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                        <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="#">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do 
                        the same thing: they will repeat an action some numbers of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track 
                        four times and then you stop. thats a loop!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><a href="#">Functions</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. when we call our function this will run that code block
                        Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from ikea, we open up the instruction manual 
                        and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
                        Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
                        </p>
